# Placement-Management-System

This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive database 
system for managing the activities of a college placement cell. The
objective is to streamline the process of student registration, job 
postings, company profiles, and placement proceedings using a 
centralized database that can be accessed by students, placement 
officers, and recruiting companies. The methodology includes the 
analysis of the current placement process, designing a relational 
database schema, developing a user-friendly interface, and testing
the system with real-time data. The anticipated outcome is to enhance 
the efficiency of placement activities, provide analytical tools for 
performance tracking, and facilitate better communication between
all stakeholders.

To run this code use the command "streamlit run webpage.py" in your terminal.
Make sure you install all the dependencies before hand.
